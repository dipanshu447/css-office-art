# Office Vibes -- A Dev’s Desk Brought to Life

Welcome to **Office Vibes**, a purely **HTML + CSS** creation made for the [Dev.to x Axero Frontend Challenge](https://dev.to/challenges/frontend/axero). It’s not just a scene, it’s a *vibe*. A tribute to every late-night coder, coffee-sipper, and bug-fixer out there.

## The Concept

This isn't a typical landing page or component UI. **Office Vibes** is a fully handcrafted CSS art piece, a miniature dev world frozen in a moment:

- **Monitor #1**: Our developer's current tab shows their code editor… and the browser tab beside it? An error. Classic.
- **Books**: Scattered and tilted, like the ones we *swear* we’ll finish.
- **Lamps & Lighting**: Warm ambient glows to set the warm hacking tone.
- **Coffee Mug**: Left mid-sip, likely in the middle of fixing that nasty bug.
- **Whiteboard**: Project plans, stickies, ideas scribbled all over, organized chaos.

Every element is intentional, reflecting a developer’s environment with nuance, humor, and heart.

## Built With

> **No JavaScript. No libraries. No frameworks. Just HTML + CSS.**

- Pure `div`-based composition
- CSS animations (cursor blinks, hover effects, skewed layouts)
- Dark UI inspired by **vscode** and **macOS Terminal**
- Manual color tuning and layering to mimic depth

## Challenge Purpose

This project was built as part of the **Axero Frontend Challenge** hosted on Dev.to, focused on CSS-only creativity. The goal? Craft something visually delightful without relying on JavaScript or component frameworks.

## Inspiration

The developer life isn’t always about clean UIs and perfect pixels. It's coffee cups left half-full, error messages haunting us, and scattered notes filled with TODOs and dreams.  
This project visually tells **that** story, the messy, beautiful side of coding that we all live through.

## What I Learned

- Creating CSS art from scratch with just HTML & CSS
- Using `skew()`, `translate()`, and shadow layering to simulate 3D
- Designing within constraints (no JS!) while still adding depth
- Styling UI elements to reflect real-world dev tools (terminal, browser, etc.)
